Fri Jan 30 11:39:54 1998  Andrew McCallum  <mccallum@jprc.com>

	* argp.h (struct argp): Remove "__const" from OPTIONS, so that
 	bow_method_register_with_name() can change the GROUP number.

Tue Apr 29 12:58:05 1997  Andrew McCallum  <mccallum@jprc.com>

	* Makefile.in (DIST_FILES): Add $(ARGP_GETOPT_C_FILES) and
 	$(ARGP_CHECK_C_FILES).

Wed Apr  9 11:31:49 1997  Andrew McCallum  <mccallum@jprc.com>

	* configure.in: Add -O to the default CFLAGS.

Tue Apr  8 13:14:55 1997  Andrew McCallum  <mccallum@jprc.com>

	* Makefile.in (DIST_FILES): Add argp-fmtstream.h and
 	argp-namefrob.h.

Mon Mar 31 12:03:57 1997  Andrew McCallum  <mccallum@jprc.com>

	* Makefile.in (configure, config.status): Sprinkle with $(srcdir).

	* configure.in: Move the setting of CFLAGS above AC_PROC_CC, so
 	that it will have an effect.

	* configure.in: Do AC_SUBST() for CPPFLAGS and CFLAGS.
	* Makefile.in (CFLAGS): Set it in configure.
	(CPPFLAGS): Likewise, and don't put $(DEFS) here; its already in
	ALL_CPPFLAGS.

Tue Mar 25 13:10:59 1997  Andrew McCallum  <mccallum@jprc.com>

	* configure.in: Fix typo.

	* argp-parse.c (__argp_parse): Set PROGRAM_INVOCATION_NAME and
 	PROGRAM_INVOCATION_SHORT_NAME if the system doesn't.

	* argp.h: Include <limits.h>.
	(__option_is_short): Make sure __KEY is less than UCHAR_MAX before
	passing it to ISPRINT().  On SunOS ISPRINT() uses a lookup-table
 	of limited size.

	* argp-ex4.c: Don't include <error.h>; it doesn't appear on my
 	RedHat system.
	(main): Use fprintf() and abort() instead of error().

	* getopt.c: Include <string.h> (for strncmp()).

	* configure.in: Check for the `ssize_t' type.

Tue Mar 25 15:15:53 1997  Andrew McCallum  <mccallum@jprc.com>

	* configure.in: Check for memmove, vsnprintf, sterror,
 	<strings.h>.  If we don't have vsnprintf(), check to see if
 	vsprintf() returns an int or a char*.

	* argp-help.c: Include <strings.h> if we have it.  strcasecmp() is
 	defined there on SunOS.
	(canon_doc_option): As ISSPACE(**NAME), not ISSPACE(*NAME).  Likewise
	with ISALNUM().
	(__argp_failure): Use work around if we don'thave STRERROR().

	* argp-fmtstream.c: Include <assert.h>.  Define memmove() with
 	bcopy() if we don't have memmove(). Define PRINTF_SIZE_GUESS to be
 	larger if we don't have vsnprintf().
	(__argp_fmtstream_printf): Implement vsnprintf() in terms of
	vsprintf() if we don't have vsnprintf().

Fri Mar 14 10:15:00 1997  Andrew McCallum  <mccallum@jprc.com>

	* Makefile.in (snap): New target.

	* Makefile.in (ARGP_C_FILES): Add new files from argp-x10.
	(ARGP_CHECK_C_FILES): New variable.
	(ARGP_CHECK_O_FILES): New variable.
	(ARGP_CHECK_PROGRAMS): New variable.
	(ALL_CPPFLAGS, ALL_CFLAGS): New variables.
	(.c.o): New pattern rule, using above two variables.
	(checks, $(ARGP_CHECK_PROGRAMS)): New targets.

	* argp.h: Declare extern program_invocation_name and
 	program_invocation_short_name if configure didn't find them.
	* configure.in: Check for strndup and program_invocation_name.

	* pin.c: New file.

	* All files updated from Miles Bader's argp-x10 release from
	ftp://alpha.gnu.ai.mit.edu/gnu/.

Tue Feb  4 13:14:01 1997  Andrew McCallum  <mccallum@jprc.com>

	* Makefile.in (scmdir): Variable removed.

Mon Feb  3 14:03:56 1997  Andrew McCallum  <mccallum@jprc.com>

	* argp1.h: Include both <memory.h> and <strings.h>, even though
 	they may conflict on some systems.

	Resolve issues of alternate string functions, like rindex().
	* configure.in: Check for ANSI/non-ANSI string functions.
	* Makefile.in (DIST_FILES): Add argp1.h.
	* argp-help.c: Include "argp1.h".
	(argp_failure): Deal if we don't HAVE_STRERROR.
	* argp-parse.c: Include "argp1.h".
	* configure.in: Look for strerror().

	Provide getopt_long() if the host system doesn't have it.
	* Makefile.in (CPPFLAGS): Add $(DEFS).
	(ARGP_GETOPT_C_FILES, ARGP_GETOPT_O_FILES): New variables.
	(libargp.a): Depend on @ARGP_GETOPT_O_FILES@, which is set by
	configure if getopt_long isn't found.
	(DIST_FILES): Add getopt.h.
	(clean): Also remove tester.
	(tester): Depend on libargp.a.
	* argp.h: Include "getopt.h" if we don't HAVE_GETOPT_H.
	* configure.in: Look for getopt_long, and cause libargp to include
 	it if it isn't found.
	* getopt.c, getopt1.c, getopt.h: New files.

	* tester.c: Remove some unused variables, and prevent other
 	warnings.

Thu Jan 30 10:26:34 1997  Andrew McCallum  <mccallum@jprc.com>

	* argp.h: Include <string.h>.

	* argp-parse.c: Don't include <getopt.h>.

	* argp-help.c: Don't use //-style comments.

	* argp.h: Only include <getopt.h> if we have it.

	* configure.in: Check for getopt.h.

	* argp-help.c (hol_entry_help): Since the DOC string doesn't
 	properly start on the same line as the options, and doesn't indent
 	properly, indent it by 3 spaces here.

	* argp-help.c (make_hol): Set HOL->CLUSTERS and HOL->SHORT_OPTIONS
 	to zero, so we don't crash when the program is given no
 	command-line arguments.

Wed Jan 29 14:21:52 1997  Andrew McCallum  <mccallum@jprc.com>

	Comment-out and massage many sections that use the `linewrap'
 	functions (which are only found in GNU libc).  Remove other
	dependancies on GNU libc.
