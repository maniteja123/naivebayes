On 2 May, Tendulkar was elected to seat number 103 in the Rajya Sabha[387] and took the oath on 4 June.[388] He refused to take the bungalow allotted to him in New Delhi calling it "waste of tax payer's money" as he resides in Mumbai.[389] He met with some controversy over his attendance in Rajya Sabha proceedings.[390] Tendulkar has also been accused of not using development fund Rajya sabha members receive.
