International Career
National call-up
The likes of Suresh Raina, Robin Uthappa, Irfan Pathan, RP Singh, Dinesh Karthik, Shikhar Dhawan and VRV Singh, who played under Rayudu's captaincy at the Under-19 level, went on to represent the national senior team while Rayudu was constantly ignored by the selectors. This was mainly due to him being a part of the now-defunct 'rebel' Indian Cricket League.
On 18 July 2012, Rayudu was included in 30 probables for the World T20 tournament to be played in Sri Lanka in September 2012[5] but failed to make it to the final squad. In December 2012, the newly formed selection panel picked Rayudu as the replacement player for the injured Manoj Tiwary for the T20 series against England. It is notable that the Chairman of this selection panel, Sandeep Patil, was also previously associated with the ICL.
During the West Indies tri-series in July 2013, Rayudu was named the replacement for Mahendra Singh Dhoni who was ruled out of the series due to a right hamstring injury.

Indian Cricket League (2007–2009)
Rayudu joined ICL, a rebel group to Indian Domestic Cricket, on 16 August 2007 with six other players from Hyderabad Cricket Association.

After his association with the ICL, he was dropped from the state team, but he continued to play in the ICL for Hyderabad Heroes.

Indian Premier League (2010–present)
Rayudu was with the Mumbai Indians in IPL 2010 as a middle order batsman/part-time wicketkeeper. His performance won many positive reviews from the critics and he was touted as a big name to be watched in the next IPL season. Being classified as an uncapped player, Rayudu was not a part of the IPL 2011 auction. Immediately after the auction, Siddhartha Mallya, Team Director of Royal Challengers Bangalore and son of RCB's owner Vijay Mallya flew to Vadodara and was seen meeting Rayudu during the Ranji Trophy final between Rajasthan and Baroda. The exact nature of the talks was unknown, but it was speculated that Rayudu rejected the offer. Mumbai Indians, who gave Rayudu a second chance after coming back from the ICL, bagged him for the 2011 season of IPL. He had another impressive season that year, scoring 395 runs in 16 matches, including 4 half-centuries. He scored a six of the last ball of the last league match against Kolkata Knight Riders to win the game on 22 May 2011, when a boundary was required. James Franklin was crucial in setting up Rayudu's last ball heroics by scoring 4 boundaries in that over and a single off of the 5th ball to give Rayudu the strike. The bowler on the receiving end of this was Lakshmipathy Balaji.
